# This Makefile is for the the demo program that reads a BMP file

# To use this Makefile, you type:
#
#        make 
#                  

# Libraries are assumed to be in the default search paths
# as are any required include files

# Stuff that depends on the specific program we're compiling
# To use this file for other programs, you'll need to change things
# in this section.

# The name of the output program 
PROG = showBMP

# Object files that go into the final executable
OBJS = showBMP.o readBMP.o

# Header files 
HDRS = readBMP.h

########
# Finally, the commands that actually make stuff
# You shouldn't have to change anything here 
# These commands are of the form:
#   output_thing:  stuff it depends on
#   <TAB> command to make output_thing 
########

# re-link the program when the object files change
$(PROG):  $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS) -o $(PROG) 

# change a C object file whenever the corresponding source file
# or any of the header files changes
%.o : %.c $(HDRS) 
	$(CC) -c -g  $(INCLUDE) $<
# What this means: 
# The %.o and %.c mean any .o file and the corresponding .c file
# All .c's are recompiled if you change one of the header files
# The $< symbol refers to the FIRST dependancy - so don't try to
# put $(HDRS) before %.c!

# change a C++ object file whenever the corresponding source file
# or any of the header files changes
%.o : %.cpp $(HDRS) 
	$(C++) -c $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) $<
